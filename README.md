* As you know, TensorFlow is a powerful library for numerical computation, particularly well suited and fine-tuned for large-scale Machine Learning.
* Its core is very similar to NumPy, but with GPU support. 
* It supports distributed computing (across multiple devices and servers). 
* It includes a kind of _`just-in-time (JIT)`_ compiler that allows it to optimize computations for speed and memory usage. 
* It works by extracting the computation graph from a Python function, then optimizing it (e.g., by pruning unused nodes), and finally running it efficiently (e.g., by automatically running independent operations in parallel). 
* Computation graphs can be exported to a portable format, so you can train a TensorFlow model in one environment (e.g., using Python on Linux) and run it in another (e.g., using Java on an Android device). 
* It implements _`autodiff`_ (_auto differentiation_, _reverse autodeff_ in _backpropagation_) and provides some excellent optimizers, such as _`RMSProp`_ and _`Nadam`_, so you can easily minimize all sorts of loss functions.
